     <h1>Software</h1>
     <hr>
     <p><strong>Software</strong>is a collection of instructions and data that tell a computer how to work. This is in contrast to physical hardware, from which the system is built and actually performs the work. In computer science and software engineering, computer software is all information processed by computer systems, including programs and data. Computer software includes computer programs, libraries and related non-executable data, such as online documentation or digital media. Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used on its own.</p>
     <p>At the lowest programming level, executable code consists of machine language instructions supported by an individual processor—typically a central processing unit (CPU) or a graphics processing unit (GPU). A machine language consists of groups of binary values signifying processor instructions that change the state of the computer from its preceding state. For example, an instruction may change the value stored in a particular storage location in the computer—an effect that is not directly observable to the user. An instruction may also invoke one of many input or output operations, for example displaying some text on a computer screen; causing state changes which should be visible to the user. The processor executes the instructions in the order they are provided, unless it is instructed to "jump" to a different instruction, or is interrupted by the operating system. As of 2015, most personal computers, smartphone devices and servers have processors with multiple execution units or multiple processors performing computation together, and computing has become a much more concurrent activity than in the past.</p>

            <td><p>his is the most common type of computer software, and can be defined as end-user programs that help you perform tasks or achieve a desired outcome. The end-user is the person who is actually using a product or program. (They are the one for whom the “end result” is designed.) Some examples of application software include internet browsers, a CRM tool like Hubspot, a photo-editing software like Adobe or Lightroom, or a word processing application like Microsoft Word. Application software is installed on a computer or mobile device based upon a user’s need. Because this is the most common type of software, there are many options available and users can choose the one that best fits their needs, budget, and expectations. (For example, anyone wanting to look on the internet could use Chrome, Safari, or even Firefox.)</p></td>

This is system software in action: there is a tweak made to the system software that helps your computer or phone continue to work well and keep applications running. Apple’s iOS is an example of system software, as is Microsoft Windows. System software is always running in the background of your device, but it is never something you will use directly. In fact, the only time most people remember it’s there is when it is time for an update.</p></td>

These are programs that are used to write, develop, test, and debug other software programs. It’s helpful to think of these programs as a translator of sorts: they take programming languages like Laravel, Python, C++, and more and translate them into something a computer or phone will understand. </p></td>

     <h1>Different Types of Software</h1>
     <hr>
     <h2><strong>1.System Software</strong></h2>
     <p>A system software aids the user and the hardware to function and interact with each other. Basically, it is a software to manage computer hardware behavior so as to provide basic functionalities that are required by the user. In simple words, we can say that system software is an intermediator or a middle layer between the user and the hardware. These computer software sanction a platform or environment for the other software to work in. This is the reason why system software is very important in managing the entire computer system. When you first turn on the computer, it is the system software that gets initialized and gets loaded in the memory of the system. The system software runs in the background and is not used by the end-users. This is the reason why system software is also known as ‘low-level software’.</p><br>
     
     <h1>Some common system software examples are:</h1>
     <strong>.</strong><strong>Operating System:</strong><p>It is the most prominent example of System Software. It is a collection of software that handles resources and provides general services for the other applications that run over them. Although each Operating System is different, most of them provide a Graphical User Interface through which a user can manage the files and folders and perform other tasks. Every device, whether a desktop, laptop or mobile phone requires an operating system to provide the basic functionality to it. As an OS essentially determines how a user interacts with the system, therefore many users prefer to use one specific OS for their device. There are various types of operating system such as real-time, embedded, distributed, multiuser, single-user, internet, mobile, and many more. It is important to consider the hardware specifications before choosing an operating system. </p>
     <h2>Some examples of Operating systems given below:</h2>
     <ul>
         <li>Android</li>
         <li>CentOS</li>
         <li>iOS</li>
         <li>Linux</li> 
         <li>Linux</li> 
         <li>Mac OS</li>
         <li>MS Windows</li>
         <li>Ubuntu</li>
     </ul>
     <hr>
     <strong>.</strong><strong>Device Drivers:</strong><p> It is a type of software that controls particular hardware which is attached to the system. Hardware devices that need a driver to connect to a system include displays, sound cards, printers, mice and hard disks. Further, there are two types of device drivers: Kernel Device Drivers and User Device Driver. Some examples of device drivers are:</p>
     <ul>
         <li>BIOS Driver</li>
         <li>Display Drivers</li>
         <li>Motherboard Drivers</li>
         <li> Printer Drivers</li>
         <li>ROM Drivers</li>
         <li>Sound card Driver</li>
         <li>USB Drivers</li>
         <li> USB Drivers</li>
         <li>VGA Drivers</li>
         <li>Virtual Device Drivers</li>
     </ul>
